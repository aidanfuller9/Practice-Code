            Cities built around trains and walkability give people much more of a choice and there is more variety in modes 
            <br>
            <br>
            Since it isn’t a requirement to drive, people can decide which method works best for them and their situation which can be really useful to people who don’t have enough money to buy and maintain a vehicle 
        </div>
        <div class="col2">
            The most effective thing seems to be providing people with alternatives so they have more of a choice on what method of transportation they want to use.

        <div class="col">
            Designing a city that is more around other modes of transit and not specifically for cars can help solve the issue  
            <br>
            <br>
            A lot of towns are designed around cars, which can be useful for some things but often forces people to drive because everything is so spread out that any other method would take far too long.

            YouTube channel ‘Not Just Bikes’ 
            <br>
            <br>
            The channel focuses on educating people on the issue by comparing various places and commenting on the pros and cons of different methods of transportation and city planning.

           Technology to spread awareness and help people understand some of the steps that need to be taken as well as helping in the actual design of new infrastructure.

            Urban planning
            <br>
            <br>
            Urban design this is a rather broad example, but technology should be used in creating diagrams, graphs, and the architectural aspect of designing areas that are more comfortable for pedestrians and other methods of transportation, not just cars.

        <p style="font-size:35px;"> Implications </p>
      </div>

    <div class="row2">
        <div class="col">
            The best way to spread awareness is to avoid attacking people or being harsh about it, blaming a specific group or person for it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Blame creates resentment and division between people. It's better to help people understand the root causes and some of the things that can be done to reduce the severity of the issue while making sure they understand that this creates more freedom for people.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
           Use real world examples to compare and contrast different models. 
           <br>
           <br>
           Examples help people develop a better understanding of differences in various countries or cities and the steps they can take to change some of the issues in their own community.
