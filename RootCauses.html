            According to the research paper ‘The Climate Value of Cycling’ by University of Twente professor Martin van Maarseveen, the term ‘Induced Demand’ regards the idea that there is a constant circle of car dependency, in which the value of different transportation models varies based on the infrastructure of the city. In cities designed around cars, other modes will be less convenient, and vice versa. 
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            Induced demand furthers car dependency because in most developed countries, especially in the United States, cities have been constructed to fit cars. This leaves them spread out and most people have no option but to drive places, any other mode would be too time consuming. If cities were more condensed and had better support for walking, cycling, public transportation, etc., people would have more of a choice and cars would not be a requirement for those who cannot or do not want to drive.
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            As stated by Professor Danial Monsefi Parapari at the Shahrood University of Technology in his paper ‘Automobile Dependency: Improving urban resilience through urban planning and design,’ induced demand is furthered by the ‘Cycle of Automobile Dependency.’ A diagram showing this cycle is provided. It doesn’t have a specific starting point, but rather a complete circle that has spiraled out of control. Increased vehicle ownership leads to specific planning and less variety in options as other modes receive less funding. This leads to large sprawl through the space required for driving and parking, and the cycle repeats. 
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            This cycle essentially forces most people to drive places, because walking or biking is too time consuming and public transportation does not have enough routes. Since most towns are constructed to fit this model, most people have no choice but to drive. This is great for some people, but in urban cities there should be more options for commuting. 
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            It is extremely difficult, but somehow the cycle of induced demand will have to be broken or altered to make it less severe. Since they all build on each other, they will all need to be changed at the same time. One at a time will not work, because it will likely be useless and quickly reverted back to its original state.

            Professor Danial Monsefi Parapari at the Shahrood University of Technology in Iran compares the evolution of various worldwide city models, their origins, how each of them contributes to different forms of induced demand in his paper ‘Automobile Dependency: Improving urban resilience through urban planning and design.’ He first comments on a ‘Traditional Walking City,’ a model “restricted to a walkable distance during the age of human…transportation until…the 19th century.” Next, he discusses the more recent layout of cities called the ‘Automobile Dependent City.’ This model really gained influence during the industrial revolution, in which immigrants from all over the world traveled to the United States to escape crowded towns and pursue a more spacious, individual life.

            While a suburban area is often more peaceful and gives people more space for their families, it commonly causes problems for many who commute daily into more populous cities for work. It is often too time consuming to walk, and public transportation does not have enough specific routes. This forces people to drive instead of any other mode. Some people benefit from vehicles for their jobs, but the majority of people just commute to an office, and they don’t need to carry anything.

            In the ‘Theory of urban fabrics: planning the walking, transit/public transport and automobile/motor car cities for reduced car dependency’ written by Peter Newman at Curtin University compares four different cities and how they compare in terms of transportation methods. In two ‘Auto Cities,’ Boston and Melbourne, the car dominates the mode of transportation, with very little alternative methods. Over the years, car use continued to rise, while other modes were reduced because of low funding and use. In a ‘Transit City,’ Munich, and a ‘Walking City,’ Singapore, transportation is divided much more equally and provides residents with much more variety in their commute. 
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            Cities planned with diversity are much more considerate to all methods of transportation. In car dependent cities, cars dominate transportation while other methods suffer, which forces people to drive. More diverse cities, however, are much more equal, so people have the freedom to decide which one to use.

            The most probable solution to enact right now is better transportation alternatives. This means making more bus routes as well as better and safer pedestrian and bicycle paths. It would be impossible to simply reduce the size of towns and cities to make them less spread out, so the best solution for urban environments is to provide those who need simple transportation to and from work, school, etc. with the means to do so. Providing people with more of a choice is the first step.
